MDAV microaggregation report
Input file rows: 40
Quasi-identifiers used (distance computation): ['Age', 'ZIP', 'SystolicBP', 'BMI']
k (anonymity parameter): 2

Method notes:
 - The values of the insensitive columns were suppressed to '*'.
 - Scaling used for distance computations: minmax
 - MDAV procedure: while |R| >= 3k: pick centroid of R, find farthest A, farthest B from A, form k-nearest groups around A and B. Then handle remainder.

Privacy check:
 - number of clusters formed: 20
 - cluster sizes (ClusterID: size): {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 2, 10: 2, 11: 2, 12: 2, 13: 2, 14: 2, 15: 2, 16: 2, 17: 2, 18: 2, 19: 2, 20: 2}
 - privacy satisfied (every cluster size >= k): True

Quality metrics:
 - SSE (sum of squared errors) in original QI space: 1275.155000
 - average cluster radius (mean of per-cluster avg distances): 4.882230
