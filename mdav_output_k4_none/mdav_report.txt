MDAV microaggregation report
Input file rows: 40
Quasi-identifiers used (distance computation): ['Age', 'ZIP', 'SystolicBP', 'BMI']
k (anonymity parameter): 4

Method notes:
 - The values of the insensitive columns were suppressed to '*'.
 - Scaling used for distance computations: None
 - MDAV procedure: while |R| >= 3k: pick centroid of R, find farthest A, farthest B from A, form k-nearest groups around A and B. Then handle remainder.

Privacy check:
 - number of clusters formed: 10
 - cluster sizes (ClusterID: size): {1: 4, 2: 4, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 4, 6: 4, 7: 4, 8: 4, 9: 4, 10: 4}
 - privacy satisfied (every cluster size >= k): True

Quality metrics:
 - SSE (sum of squared errors) in original QI space: 1230.497500
 - average cluster radius (mean of per-cluster avg distances): 6.507248
